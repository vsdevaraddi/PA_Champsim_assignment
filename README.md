# PA_Champsim_assignment

ChampSim is a trace-based simulator for a microarchitecture study which uses traces to emulate a processor execution. Champsim comes with example implementation of branch predictors, Prefetchers and Replacement policies. In this assignment we have implemented,

Branch Predictors -> Three variants of Gshare, Pshare, Tournament Predictor.
Prefetcher -> Best Offset Predictor Prefetecher
Replacement policy -> BIP, DIP policy

The results of Branch Predictors(results/branch_predictors_result) were examined on eight traces.
The results of Prefetechers(results/prefetechers_result) were examined on eight traces.
The results of Replacement policy(results/replacements_result) were examined on eight traces.
